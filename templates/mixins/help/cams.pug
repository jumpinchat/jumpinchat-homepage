          | JumpInChat uses a technology called WebRTC for video streams, which is a way to transfer data to and from a browser.
          | WebRTC is supported on the latest versions most major browsers except Internet Explorer.
          | In order to view and broadcast you will need either Chrome (or other Blink-based browsers) or Firefox.
          | It should also work on later versions of Android (e.g. Chrome Mobile and Samsung Internet), as well as versions of
          | iOS Safari 12.2 and later.

        h2#permissions
          a(href="#permissions") Browser permissions
        p
          | In order to broadcast, your browser must have permission to access your audio and video media sources.
          | Your browser should ask for permissions for your webcam and microphone when you select them, but you can also define them yourself from the site settings dropdown in your browser.

        h2 Screen sharing
        p
          | Screen sharing is supported for desktop browsers only currently (Chrome and Firefox).
          | Firefox supports it out-of-the-box. Chrome, however, requires an extension due to increased restrictions on permissions.
          | You can get the Chrome extension
          | <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/janus-webrtc-screensharin/hapfgfdkleiggjjpfpenajgdnfckjpaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

          h3#debug-unavailable
            a(href="#debug-unavailable") Video source is unavailable

          h4 "Constraints could not be satisfied" error

          p
            | Errors of this type typically mean the video source you're attempting to use
            | doesn't support the resolution chosen to broadcast with. For example, if the
            | chosen resolution is 480p (640x480) but the source only outputs 1920x1080,
            | the browser will not be able to access it.
          p
            | In most cases, this will happen when you attempt to use a virtual media device
            | rather than an actual webcam. If this is the case, try and make sure the
            | virtual webcam outputs at a usable resolution.

          p
            | For more information about what resolutions your devices can output, check out
            | the media internals (<code>chrome://media-internals</code>) page, if you're on Chrome, and
            | open the "Video Capture" tab. This will show a table of devices and formats (resolutions)
            | available for use.

          h4 "Failed to allocate videosource" or "Could not start video source" error

          p
            | This error occurs when a video source is already in use by another process.
            | Essentially, the operating system has reserved the device and prevents
            | anything else using it.

          p
            | The only way to fix this error is to stop the other process from using the
            | device. If this fails to work, you must either close the suspect program,
            | or restart your computer if all else fails.

          h4 "Permission denied" error

          p
            | You have previously denied the browser permission to access the media device(s)
            | and must manually allow it.

          p
            | See the section on <a href="#permissions">browser permissions</a> to see how
            | to allow access.
